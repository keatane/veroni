# Veroni - VnI
Veroni is a cmd-automated script to install custom packages in Windows (10)

The main idea is to install from a fresh installation of Windows all the custom packages and programs I personally chose for my lifestyle. 
In other words, it is a batch script that allows to install with just a run some custom packages and programs hard-coded into the scripts.

I do not assure that the scripts works well. But please take in mind that once started the scripts will checks and install stuff immediately.

Feel free to choose the version between:
- work.bat --> focus on python programming, docker and other stuff
- gaming.bat --> focus on gaming platforms
- daily.bat --> a mix of the above, my personal pc

Do not take this code as professional work.
Cheers
